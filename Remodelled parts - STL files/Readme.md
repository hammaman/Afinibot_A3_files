# Remodelled parts

The X-Axis left and right hand side parts supplied were not very good; and had cracked on my printer (probably as a result of having the extruder too low).

I have designed new parts (as I cannot find the original STL files anywhere online), based on the models for the Prusa i3 MK3S.

The main adjustments made are as follows:
- the right hand x-axis idler is designed so that the two rods pass completely through it.  The holes may need to be slightly widened to make a tight fit, but also allow the rods to slide through without too much effort.
- a new part has been designed to attach to the right of the x-axis idler to hold the rods steady.  This connects using a M3 screw (30mm or longer) and a square M3 nut inserted into the slot in the x-axis idler.
- the left hand x-axis motor is designed so that the belt is set up quite tight, and then can be adjusted by inserting a M3 screw in the top.

As a result of the new parts, the alignment of the belt is slightly different.  A new part is required to be inserted on the back of the extruder where the belt is attached, so that the belt runs in the same plane as the rods.

Also, the z-axis switch needs to be further away from the frame, and a new part is required to act as a spacer.
