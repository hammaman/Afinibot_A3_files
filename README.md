# Afinibot_A3_files

The Afinibot A3 3D printer is a 3D printer in acrylic which has been classified as a Migbot Prusa i3 variant (see https://reprap.org/wiki/Migbot_Prusa_i3).

It appears to use a Melzi controller board (see https://www.reprap.org/wiki/Melzi).

Repository for Afinibot A3 files:
 - Original build instructions
 - FTDI USB drivers
  - A3 firmware from Afinibot forum (https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/3d-printer-firmware/26569)

Plus additional STL files from redesign of X-Axis parts (based on those for Prusa i3 MK3S)
